## 🔧 **Technical Improvements**

### **📧 EmailService (Simplified)**

```javascript
// Before: 3 providers, complex fallback logic, 400+ lines
// After: 1 provider (Resend), clean code, ~150 lines

const EMAIL_PROVIDER = {
  RESEND: "resend", // Only provider needed!
  NONE: "none",
};

// Single email sending method
await emailService.send({
  to: selectedRecipient, // Single recipient only
  subject: "Health Check Results",
  html: reportHTML,
});
```

### **🎛️ UI (Drastically Simplified)**

```javascript
// Before: Multiple sections, complex state management
// After: Single email section, simple recipient selection

const [selectedRecipient, setSelectedRecipient] = useState(
  "kurisuuuchannn@gmail.com"
);
const [customRecipient, setCustomRecipient] = useState("");
const [notificationSettings, setNotificationSettings] = useState({
  emailAlertsEnabled: false,
  dailyEmailEnabled: false,
  dailyEmailTime: "09:00",
});
```

### **💾 Settings Storage**

```javascript
// Simplified settings structure
{
  "emailAlertsEnabled": true,
