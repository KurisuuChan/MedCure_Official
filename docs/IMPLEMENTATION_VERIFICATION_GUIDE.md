   - ‚úÖ Added local debounce properties to constructor
   - ‚úÖ Added `notification_key` to `notifyLowStock()`
   - ‚úÖ Added `notification_key` to `notifyCriticalStock()`
   - ‚úÖ Added `notification_key` to `notifyExpiringSoon()`
   - ‚úÖ Added local debounce check in `runHealthChecks()`
   - ‚úÖ Changed query to `.limit(1)` for single admin
   - ‚úÖ Simplified user selection logic
   - ‚úÖ Added timestamp tracking after completion

### Database Migration Created ‚úÖ

2. **NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM_MIGRATION.sql** - Ready to execute:
   - ‚úÖ `health_check_runs` table
   - ‚úÖ `should_send_notification()` function (24-hour deduplication)
   - ‚úÖ `should_run_health_check()` function (15-minute intervals)
   - ‚úÖ `record_health_check_run()` function
   - ‚úÖ Enhanced `cleanup_old_notifications()` function
   - ‚úÖ 4 performance indexes
   - ‚úÖ Verification queries included

---

## üöÄ Step 1: Execute Database Migration

**Time Required:** 2-3 minutes

### Instructions:

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**

   - Go to your Supabase project
   - Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

2. **Create New Query**

   - Click "New query" button

3. **Copy Migration SQL**

   - Open file: `database/NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM_MIGRATION.sql`
   - Select all content (Ctrl+A)
   - Copy (Ctrl+C)

4. **Execute Migration**

   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor (Ctrl+V)
   - Click **"Run"** button or press Ctrl+Enter

5. **Verify Success**
   You should see output like:

   ```
   ‚úÖ Notification system migration completed successfully!

   Verification Results:
   - health_check_runs: Table exists
   - should_send_notification: Function exists
   - should_run_health_check: Function exists
   - record_health_check_run: Function exists
   ```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è If You See Errors:

**"relation already exists"**

- This is fine! It means part of the migration was already run
- Continue to next step

**"permission denied"**

- Make sure you're logged in as the database owner
- Try running from Supabase dashboard instead of local client

**"function does not exist"**

- The migration may have partially failed
- Drop existing functions and re-run:
  ```sql
  DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS should_send_notification CASCADE;
  DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS should_run_health_check CASCADE;
  DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS record_health_check_run CASCADE;
  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS health_check_runs CASCADE;
  ```
- Then re-run the full migration

## üß™ Step 2: Test POS Low-Stock Notifications

**Time Required:** 5 minutes

### Before Testing:

1. Open your application
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Clear console (click trash icon)

### Test Procedure:

1. **Navigate to POS Page**

   - Click on "Point of Sale" in sidebar

2. **Find a Low-Stock Product**

   - Look for products with stock near reorder level
   - OR manually set a product's `reorder_level` higher in database

3. **Perform Sale**

   - Add product to cart
   - Process transaction
   - Complete payment

4. **Check Console Logs**
   Look for these specific logs:

   ```
   üîé [LowStockCheck] Checking product: [Product Name]
   üìä Current Stock: XX pieces
   üìä Reorder Level: YY pieces
   ‚ö†Ô∏è ALERT: Product is below reorder level!
   ```

5. **Check Notification Bell**
   - Click notification bell in header
   - Verify notification appears with **CORRECT** piece count
   - Example: "Product XYZ is low in stock (45 pieces remaining)"
   - Should **NOT** show "0 pieces" anymore! ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria:

- [ ] Console shows correct `stock_in_pieces` value
- [ ] Notification shows same correct piece count
- [ ] No duplicate notifications appear
- [ ] Notification has "low-stock" tag

### üö® If Test Fails:

**Still shows "0 pieces":**

```javascript
// Check if this console log appears:
console.log("üîé [LowStockCheck] Checking product:", product);
```

- If you see `stock: 0` but `stock_in_pieces: 45`, the fix worked!
- The notification should now use `stock_in_pieces`

**No notification appears:**

- Check if product is actually below reorder level
- Verify notification service initialized: Look for "NotificationService initialized"
- Check Supabase connection in Network tab

**Duplicate notifications:**

- Check database: `SELECT * FROM user_notifications WHERE notification_key LIKE 'low-stock:%'`
- Should only see ONE entry per product

---

## üè• Step 3: Test Health Check System

**Time Required:** 5-10 minutes

### Test Procedure:

1. **Trigger Health Check Manually**
   Open browser console and run:

   ```javascript
   // Get the notification service instance
   const notificationService =
     window.notificationService ||
     JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("notificationService"));

   // Trigger health check
   notificationService.runHealthChecks();
   ```

2. **Check Console Output**
   Should see:

   ```
   üè• Starting health checks...
   ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping health check (ran X minutes ago, must wait 15 minutes)
   ```

   OR (if enough time passed):

   ```
   üè• Starting health checks...
   ‚úÖ Health checks completed, notified: user@example.com
   ```

3. **Verify Database Records**
   Run in Supabase SQL Editor:

   ```sql
   -- Check health check runs
   SELECT * FROM health_check_runs
   ORDER BY run_timestamp DESC
   LIMIT 5;

   -- Check notifications sent
   SELECT user_id, message, created_at
   FROM user_notifications
   WHERE message LIKE '%low stock%'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. **Verify Only ONE Admin Notified**
   ```sql
   -- Count notifications per health check run
   SELECT
     DATE_TRUNC('minute', created_at) as run_time,
     COUNT(*) as notification_count
   FROM user_notifications
   WHERE message LIKE '%stock%' OR message LIKE '%expir%'
   GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('minute', created_at)
   ORDER BY run_time DESC;
   ```
   - Each row should show `notification_count: 1` (not 3 or 4!)

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria:

- [ ] Health check respects 15-minute interval
- [ ] Only ONE admin receives notifications per run
- [ ] `health_check_runs` table shows records
- [ ] No spam notifications every second
- [ ] Local debounce prevents rapid re-runs

### üö® If Test Fails:

**Still getting multiple notifications:**

- Check if migration ran: `SELECT * FROM health_check_runs`
- Verify query uses `.limit(1)`: Search NotificationService.js for "limit(1)"

**Health check runs too frequently:**

- Check `healthCheckDebounceMs` in constructor (should be 900000 = 15 min)
- Verify `lastHealthCheckRun` is being set after completion

**Database function errors:**

- Re-run migration SQL
- Check function exists: `SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines WHERE routine_name = 'should_run_health_check'`

---

## üéâ Step 4: Full System Verification

**Time Required:** 10 minutes

### Complete System Test:

1. **Create Multiple Sales**

   - Process 5-10 transactions
   - Mix of products (some low stock, some normal)
   - Check notifications appear correctly

2. **Test Notification Deduplication**

   ```sql
   -- Check for duplicate notifications
   SELECT
     notification_key,
     COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
   FROM user_notifications
   WHERE notification_key IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY notification_key
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```

   - Should return **0 rows** (no duplicates!)

3. **Test Notification Persistence**

   - Mark notification as read
   - Refresh page
   - Notification should stay read ‚úÖ

4. **Test Real-Time Updates**

   - Open application in TWO browser tabs
   - Trigger notification in Tab 1
   - Verify notification appears in Tab 2 automatically

5. **Check Performance**
   ```sql
   -- Verify indexes exist
   SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes
   WHERE tablename = 'user_notifications';
   ```
   - Should show 4+ indexes including:
     - `idx_user_notifications_user_created`
     - `idx_user_notifications_key`
     - `idx_user_notifications_read`
     - `idx_user_notifications_cleanup`

### ‚úÖ Final Success Criteria:

- [ ] All low-stock notifications show correct piece counts
- [ ] No "0 pieces" errors appear
- [ ] No duplicate notifications
- [ ] Health checks run every 15 minutes (not every second)
- [ ] Only ONE admin gets health check notifications
- [ ] Real-time updates work across tabs
- [ ] Notifications persist after refresh
- [ ] Database functions operational

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

### Daily Checks:

1. **Check Notification Volume**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     DATE(created_at) as date,
     COUNT(*) as total_notifications
   FROM user_notifications
   GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
   ORDER BY date DESC
   LIMIT 7;
   ```

   - Should be consistent, no sudden spikes

2. **Check Health Check Runs**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM health_check_runs
   ORDER BY run_timestamp DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

   - Should show entries every 15-20 minutes

3. **Check for Errors**
   - Look for console errors in browser
   - Check Supabase logs for database errors

### Weekly Maintenance:

1. **Run Cleanup Function**

   ```sql
   SELECT cleanup_old_notifications();
   ```

   - Removes notifications older than 30 days

2. **Check Index Performance**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     schemaname,
     tablename,
     indexname,
     idx_scan,
     idx_tup_read
   FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
   WHERE tablename = 'user_notifications';
   ```
   - Verify indexes are being used
