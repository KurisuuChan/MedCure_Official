    productId,
    productName,
    quantity,

    newStockLevel,
    userId
  );

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### 1. Out of Stock Detection

```javascript
// Test scenario:
1. Set a product stock to 0
2. Wait 15 minutes OR restart app (triggers health check)
3. Check notification bell - should show out of stock alert
```

### 2. Stock Added Notification

```javascript
// Test scenario:
1. Go to Batch Management page
2. Click "Add New Stock"
3. Fill in quantity and expiry date
4. Submit form
5. Check notification bell - should show 2 notifications:
   - Stock Added (with quantity and new stock level)
   - Batch Received (with batch number and expiry)
```

### 3. Duplicate Prevention

```javascript
// Test scenario:
1. Trigger out of stock alert
2. Wait < 24 hours
3. Trigger again - should NOT create duplicate
4. Check database: `should_send_notification()` returns false
```

## 🔒 Security & Performance

### Duplicate Prevention

- ✅ Database-level function `should_send_notification()`
- ✅ 24-hour cooldown per unique notification key

- ✅ Indexed database queries (product_id, user_id)

### Real-time Updates

- ✅ Supabase channels with postgres_changes subscription
- ✅ Instant notification delivery to UI
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates for mark as read/dismiss

## 💡 Key Implementation Details

### Why Stock Added + Batch Received?

We send **both** notifications because:

1. **Stock Added** = Business perspective (inventory increased)
2. **Batch Received** = Operational perspective (new batch tracking)

This provides **dual context** for different user needs:

- Pharmacists care about stock levels (Stock Added)
- Managers care about batch tracking (Batch Received)

### Why Out of Stock is Automated?

Out of stock is **critical** and requires:

- ⏰ **Immediate detection** (health checks every 15 min)
- 🚨 **Proactive alerts** (don't wait for user to check)
- 🎯 **Action required** (reorder immediately)
