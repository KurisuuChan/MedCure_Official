**Impact:** May miss completely depleted inventory
**Effort:** Low (1-2 hours)
**Implementation:** Add to health check system

### 2. Stock Added Notifications (High Priority)

**Why:** No audit trail when stock is added via batch management
**Impact:** Can't track inventory movements
**Effort:** Low (2-3 hours)
**Implementation:** Add hooks in batch management workflow

### 3. Batch Received Notifications (High Priority)

**Why:** No confirmation when new batches arrive
**Impact:** Inventory receiving not tracked
