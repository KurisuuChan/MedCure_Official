# üéØ Notification System Streamlined & Fixed

## Overview

Simplified and fixed the NotificationManagement component by removing redundant features, fixing database table references, and organizing features into logical tabs.

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed Critical Database Error**

- **Problem**: Query was looking for `medicines` table which doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Changed to `products` table with correct columns:
  - `stock_in_pieces` (instead of `current_stock`)
  - `reorder_level`
  - `brand_name` / `generic_name`

### 2. **Streamlined Tab Structure**

**Before**: 4 tabs (Overview, Notifications, Email Alerts, Settings)
**After**: 3 tabs (Overview, Notifications, Inventory Alerts)

### 3. **Removed Redundant Features**

- ‚ùå Removed: "Send Direct Email" test feature (not needed for production)
- ‚ùå Removed: "Email Testing" settings tab (redundant)
- ‚ùå Removed: Duplicate email input fields

### 4. **Simplified Imports**

Removed unused icons:

- `Send` (not needed after removing manual email tab)
- `Activity` (replaced with Mail icon)
- `Settings` (no settings tab anymore)

### 5. **Code Cleanup**

- Fixed all ESLint errors
- Removed unused state variables (`emailTesting`, `sendingEmail`, `testEmail`)

  .or("current_stock.lte.reorder_level,current_stock.eq.0");

// ‚úÖ AFTER (Correct table and columns)
const { data: products, error } = await supabase
  .from("products")
  .select("id, brand_name, generic_name, stock_in_pieces, reorder_level")
  .or("stock_in_pieces.eq.0,stock_in_pieces.lte.reorder_level");
```

### Component Size Reduction
