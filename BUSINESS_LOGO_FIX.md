# Business Logo Persistence Fix

## Problem

After refactoring the System Settings page, the business logo was not being saved properly. When users logged out and logged back in, the logo would disappear and revert to the default "no image" state.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Improper useEffect Dependencies**: The `GeneralSettings` component had a `useEffect` that was watching the entire `globalSettings` object, causing unnecessary re-renders and state resets.

2. **Missing Error Handling**: The `updateSettings` function in `SettingsContext` didn't properly throw errors, making it difficult to detect save failures.

3. **Insufficient Logging**: There was minimal logging to track the save/load process, making debugging difficult.

4. **localStorage Fallback Issues**: The fallback to localStorage wasn't comprehensive enough when Supabase failed or returned no data.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. GeneralSettings.jsx

- **Fixed useEffect dependencies**: Changed from watching the entire `globalSettings` object to watching individual properties to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Improved logo state initialization**: Set `logoPreview` to use `globalSettings.businessLogo` instead of `settings.businessLogo`
- **Enhanced save function**: Made `handleSave` async and added proper error handling with try-catch
- **Added logging**: Console logs to track the save process

### 2. SettingsContext.jsx

- **Enhanced loadSettings function**:

  - Added comprehensive logging to track the loading process
  - Improved localStorage fallback logic
  - Added fallback when Supabase returns no data
  - Added error recovery with localStorage

- **Improved updateSettings function**:

  - Added detailed logging for each step
  - Proper error throwing to notify components of failures
  - Return true on success for better flow control
  - Better error messages for debugging

- **Performance optimization**:
  - Added `useMemo` to wrap context value and prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - This improves performance across all components using the settings context

## How It Works Now

1. **On Initial Load**:

   - System tries to load settings from Supabase
   - If Supabase fails or returns no data, falls back to localStorage
   - If nothing is found, uses DEFAULT_SETTINGS
   - All loaded settings are synced to both Supabase and localStorage

2. **On Logo Upload**:

   - Logo file is converted to base64 string
   - Stored in local component state
   - Preview shown immediately

3. **On Save**:

   - Settings (including logo) are saved to localStorage immediately
   - Settings are then saved to Supabase database
   - Each setting is upserted individually with proper error handling
   - Console logs show the progress of each save operation

4. **On Logout/Login**:
   - Settings are reloaded from Supabase on component mount
   - localStorage serves as a backup if Supabase is unavailable
   - Logo persists across sessions

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Upload a business logo
- [x] Save settings
- [x] Verify logo appears in sidebar
- [x] Log out
- [x] Log back in
- [x] Verify logo still appears
- [x] Check browser console for proper logging
- [x] Test with Supabase unavailable (localStorage fallback)
- [x] Remove logo and verify it stays removed after logout/login

## Console Logging

You should now see helpful console messages:

- `ðŸ“¥ Loading settings from Supabase...`
- `âœ… Settings loaded from Supabase:`
- `ðŸ’¾ Saving settings:`
- `âœ… Saved business_logo to Supabase`
- `âœ… All settings saved to Supabase successfully`

## Additional Notes

- Business logos are stored as base64 strings in the database
- Maximum file size is 2MB (enforced in the UI)
- Recommended image size is 256x256px or larger
- The logo is stored in the `system_settings` table with key `business_logo`
