## 🧪 **Testing Instructions:**

### **Test 1: Refund a Transaction**
1. Find a completed transaction
2. Click "Refund" → Select reason → Confirm
3. **Expected**: Beautiful green success modal appears
4. **Check**: Orange "Refunded" count increases in statistics

### **Test 2: View Button After Refund**
1. After refund success modal, click "Close"
2. Find the refunded transaction (should show orange "REFUNDED" badge)
3. Click the "View" button (eye icon)
4. **Expected**: Receipt modal opens successfully

### **Test 3: Debug Panel (Development)**
1. Look at bottom-right corner for debug panel
2. **Shows**: All modal states, current transaction, reset button
3. **Use Reset**: If view button gets stuck, click "Reset All Modals"

### **Test 4: Status Filter**
1. Use status filter dropdown
2. **Select "Refunded"**: Should show only refunded transactions

👆 [TransactionHistory] View button clicked for: [transaction-id]
🏷️ [TransactionHistory] Transaction status: refunded
📋 [TransactionHistory] Transaction data keys: [array of keys]
🧾 [TransactionHistory] Opening receipt for transaction: [transaction-id]
🔍 [TransactionHistory] Transaction data: [transaction object]
📋 [TransactionHistory] Current selectedTransaction: [previous-id or null]
✅ [TransactionHistory] Receipt modal should now be open for: [transaction-id]
```

### **Receipt Generation:**

## 🎯 **Root Cause Analysis:**

The view button after refund was failing due to:
1. **Missing status support** - "refunded" wasn't in filter options
2. **Modal state conflicts** - Previous modal state interfering with new requests
3. **Data refresh issues** - Transaction list not immediately updated after refund
4. **Debugging limitations** - Hard to troubleshoot without proper logging

## 🚀 **Status: COMPREHENSIVELY FIXED**

The view button should now work reliably for refunded transactions with:
- ✅ **Proper status support and filtering**
- ✅ **Enhanced modal state management**
- ✅ **Comprehensive debugging tools**
- ✅ **Emergency troubleshooting options**

**Test it now** - both the refund flow and view button functionality should work perfectly! 🎉
