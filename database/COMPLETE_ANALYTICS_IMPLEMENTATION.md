## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Calculations (auditReportsService.js)

#### Sales Report Algorithm:

```javascript
For each completed sale:
  1. Sum total_amount → totalRevenue
  2. For each sale_item:
     - Get product.cost_price
     - Calculate itemCost = cost_price × quantity
     - Sum all itemCosts → totalCOGS
  3. grossProfit = totalRevenue - totalCOGS
  4. profitMargin = (grossProfit / totalRevenue) × 100
  5. Calculate averages: revenue, cost, profit per transaction
```

#### Financial Report Algorithm:

```javascript
Advanced Calculations:
  1. COGS = Σ(sale_items.quantity × products.cost_price)
  2. Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS
  3. Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Revenue) × 100
  4. Inventory Value = Σ(products.stock × products.cost_price)
  5. Inventory Turnover = COGS / Inventory Value
  6. Days Inventory = 365 / Inventory Turnover
  7. ROI = (Gross Profit / COGS) × 100
  8. Cost Percentage = (COGS / Revenue) × 100
```

#### Inventory Report Algorithm:

```javascript
For each product:
  1. Stock Value = stock_in_pieces × price_per_piece
  2. Cost Value = stock_in_pieces × cost_price
  3. Low Stock = stock ≤ reorder_level
  4. Out of Stock = stock === 0
  5. Expiring = days_until_expiry ≤ 30
  6. Expired = days_until_expiry < 0
```

## 📊 Sample Metrics Interpretation

### Example Data:

```
Total Revenue: ₱100,000
Total COGS: ₱60,000
Gross Profit: ₱40,000
Profit Margin: 40%
Inventory Value: ₱200,000

```

### What This Means:

- **40% Profit Margin**: Healthy margin, good pricing
- **66.67% ROI**: Making ₱0.67 profit per ₱1 invested in inventory

- **Action**: Reduce inventory levels, move slow-moving stock

### Ideal Benchmarks:

- **Profit Margin**: 30-50% (excellent for pharmacy)
- **ROI**: 50-100%+ (good return)
- **Inventory Turnover**: 4-12x per year (healthy for pharmacy)
- **Days Inventory**: 30-90 days (optimal)
