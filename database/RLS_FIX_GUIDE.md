ðŸ”§ **QUICK FIX FOR USER DELETION ISSUE**
====================================

## The Problem
Your user deletion is failing because of Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase.

## Quick Test (Do this first)
1. Go to Supabase â†’ SQL Editor
2. Run this single command:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

3. Go back to your app and try deleting a user
4. If it works â†’ RLS was the problem!

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Disable RLS Temporarily
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Step 2: Test User Deletion
- Try deleting a user in your app
- If it works, continue to Step 3
- If it still doesn't work, the issue is in your code (not RLS)

### Step 3: Re-enable RLS with Simple Policies
```sql
-- Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Clean up any existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to read users" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow admin users to read users" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow admin users to update users" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow admin to manage users" ON public.users;

-- Create simple working policies
CREATE POLICY "authenticated_users_select_users" ON public.users
    FOR SELECT
    USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "authenticated_users_update_users" ON public.users
    FOR UPDATE
    USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "authenticated_users_insert_users" ON public.users
    FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "authenticated_users_delete_users" ON public.users
    FOR DELETE
    USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

### Step 4: Test Again
- Try deleting a user
- It should work now!

## If It Still Doesn't Work

1. **Check Authentication**:
```sql
SELECT auth.uid(), auth.role();
```

2. **Check if you exist in users table**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM public.users WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

3. **Check current policies**:
```sql
SELECT policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'users';
```

## Emergency Reset (Nuclear Option)
If nothing works, use this:
```sql
-- Disable RLS completely (temporarily)
ALTER TABLE public.users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Delete all policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "authenticated_users_select_users" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "authenticated_users_update_users" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "authenticated_users_insert_users" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "authenticated_users_delete_users" ON public.users;

-- Test deletion (should work now)
-- Then re-enable with simple policies above
```
