## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

After running the SQL migration, test these features:

### **Basic Functionality**

### **Advanced Features**
- [ ] **Advanced filters toggle show/hide**
- [ ] **Supplier and category filters populate with real data**
- [ ] **Stock level filtering works**
- [ ] **Date range filtering works**
- [ ] **Sorting options work in both directions**

### **Pagination**
- [ ] **Product cards paginate properly**
- [ ] **Batch table paginate properly**

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If filters don't populate**
- Ensure you've run the batch migration SQL script
- Check that products have the new medicine structure fields
- Verify suppliers and categories exist in your data

### **If pagination doesn't work**
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure ProfessionalPagination component imported correctly
- Verify filteredBatches is properly defined

### **If search is slow**
- The system is optimized but with very large datasets (>1000 batches), consider server-side filtering
- Current implementation is client-side for better responsiveness
