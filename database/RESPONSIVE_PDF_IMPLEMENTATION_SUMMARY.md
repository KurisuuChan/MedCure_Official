3. Calculate font sizes dynamically
4. Set cell padding appropriately
5. Compute column widths with priority system
6. Apply intelligent alignment rules
7. Generate PDF with optimized settings
```

### Smart Width Calculation

```javascript
For ≤5 columns: Use base widths (35mm, 28mm, etc.)
For 6-8 columns: Use 90% of base widths
