# Analytics & Reports Accuracy Fixes

**Date:** January 2025  
**Issue:** Analytics & Reports features showing inaccurate data  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🔍 Issues Found

### 1. **Low Stock Logic Inconsistency** (CRITICAL)

- **File:** `src/services/domains/analytics/auditReportsService.js`
- **Lines:** 393-395, 403-405
- **Problem:** Reports excluded out-of-stock items (stock=0) from low stock counts
- **Impact:** Inventory Report showed incorrect low stock count (9 items missing)
- **Root Cause:** Used old logic `p.stock_in_pieces > 0 && p.stock_in_pieces <= p.reorder_level`
- **Expected:** Should match Dashboard logic: `p.stock_in_pieces <= p.reorder_level` (includes stock=0)

**Before:**

```javascript
lowStock: productsData.filter(
  (p) => p.stock_in_pieces > 0 && p.stock_in_pieces <= p.reorder_level
).length,
```

**After:**

```javascript
lowStock: productsData.filter(
  (p) => p.stock_in_pieces <= (p.reorder_level || 10)
).length,
```

### 2. **Database Field Name Errors - Product Name** (8 instances)

- **File:** `src/services/domains/analytics/reportingService.js`
- **Lines:** 105, 216, 231, 276, 292, 453
- **Problem:** Used `product.name` or `products?.name` but database has `generic_name`
- **Impact:** Products appeared as "Unknown" in top products, sales reports, inventory reports
- **Result:** Incorrect data aggregation, unable to identify products correctly

**Locations Fixed:**

1. **Line 105** - `generateFinancialReport` top products
2. **Line 216** - `generateInventoryReport` low stock products
3. **Line 231** - `generateInventoryReport` expiring products
4. **Line 276** - `generateInventoryReport` product performance
5. **Line 292** - `generateInventoryReport` stock valuation
6. **Line 453** - `generateSalesPerformanceReport` top selling products

**Before:**

```javascript
const productName = item.products?.name || "Unknown";
// or
name: product.name,
```

**After:**

```javascript
const productName = item.products?.generic_name || "Unknown";
// or
name: product.generic_name,
```

### 3. **Database Field Name Error - Brand Name**

- **File:** `src/services/domains/analytics/reportingService.js`
- **Line:** 440
- **Problem:** Used `products?.brand` but database has `brand_name`
- **Impact:** All brands showed as "Generic" in brand performance reports
- **Result:** Incorrect brand analytics, unable to track brand-specific sales

**Before:**

```javascript
const brand = item.products?.brand || "Generic";
```

**After:**

```javascript
const brand = item.products?.brand_name || "Generic";
```

## 🔄 Pattern Recognition

This fix follows the same pattern as the earlier **Low Stock Discrepancy Fix**:

### Earlier Fix (Dashboard vs Inventory Page):

- **Issue:** Dashboard showed 9 low stock, Inventory showed 1
- **Cause:** Inconsistent logic - Dashboard included stock=0, Inventory excluded it
- **Fix:** Unified to `p.stock_in_pieces <= p.reorder_level`

### Current Fix (Analytics & Reports):

- **Issue:** Reports showed inaccurate data
- **Cause 1:** Same inconsistent low stock logic as above
- **Cause 2:** Field name mismatches (`name` vs `generic_name`, `brand` vs `brand_name`)
- **Fix:** Applied unified logic + corrected field names

### Products Table Fields (Correct Names):

  brand_name: string,       // ✅ USE THIS (not "brand")
  category: string,
  stock_in_pieces: number,
  reorder_level: number,    // Default: 10
  price_per_piece: number,
  cost_price: number,
  expiry_date: date,
  dosage_form: string,
  dosage_strength: string,
  drug_classification: string,

## 📝 Related Fixes

1. **ExportModal.jsx** - Fixed duplicate PDF code syntax error
2. **useInventory.js** - Unified low stock filter logic (2 locations)
3. **dashboardService.js** - Already correct (used as reference)
4. **productUtils.js** - Standardized isLowStock() function

---

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Low Stock Logic Standard:

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Use everywhere
const isLowStock = (product) => {
  const reorderLevel = product.reorder_level || 10; // fallback
  return product.stock_in_pieces <= reorderLevel; // includes stock=0
};
```

### Database Query Pattern:

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Use these field names
const { data } = await supabase.from("products").select(`
    id,
    generic_name,    // NOT "name"
    brand_name,      // NOT "brand"
    category,
    stock_in_pieces,
    reorder_level,
    price_per_piece
  `);
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **Always use `generic_name`** not `name` for products
2. **Always use `brand_name`** not `brand` for product brands
3. **Low stock includes stock=0** items (items needing reorder)
4. **Use fallback reorder_level of 10** when not set
5. **Filter out archived products** in analytics (`is_archived = false`)
6. **Only include completed transactions** in sales reports (`status = 'completed'`)

---

## ✅ Verification Commands

```javascript
// Check low stock count in console
const products = await supabase.from("products").select("*");
const lowStock = products.data.filter(
  (p) => p.stock_in_pieces <= (p.reorder_level || 10)
).length;
console.log("Low Stock Count:", lowStock);

// Verify product fields exist
console.log("Product Fields:", Object.keys(products.data[0]));
// Should include: generic_name, brand_name (not name, brand)
```
