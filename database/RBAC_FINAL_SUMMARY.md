Run the migration script to convert old roles:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- File: database/FIX_TESTING_USER_ROLE.sql

UPDATE users
SET role = 'employee', updated_at = NOW()
WHERE role = 'cashier';
```

| `cashier`     | `employee`   | 🔵 Blue     | Your "Testing User" needs this update |
| `staff`       | `employee`   | 🔵 Blue     | Basic staff members                   |
| `super_admin` | `admin`      | 🔴 Red      | Consolidated to single admin role     |
