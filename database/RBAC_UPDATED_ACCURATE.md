## 🎨 UI Implementation

### Role Badge Colors

```javascript
const getRoleColor = (role) => {
  const colors = {
    // Current roles
    admin: "bg-red-100 text-red-800", // Super admin
    pharmacist: "bg-green-100 text-green-800",
    employee: "bg-blue-100 text-blue-800",

    // Legacy roles (backward compatibility)
    super_admin: "bg-red-100 text-red-800", // → admin
    manager: "bg-green-100 text-green-800", // → pharmacist
    cashier: "bg-blue-100 text-blue-800", // → employee
    staff: "bg-blue-100 text-blue-800", // → employee
  };
  return colors[role] || "bg-gray-100 text-gray-800";
};
```

### Role Dropdown Options

Only 3 options shown when creating/editing users:

- **ADMIN** (red badge)
- **PHARMACIST** (green badge)
- **EMPLOYEE** (blue badge)

---

## 🛡️ Permission Enforcement

### Backend Enforcement

```javascript
// Check if user has specific permission
const hasPermission = (userRole, requiredPermission) => {
  const permissions = UserManagementService.ROLE_PERMISSIONS[userRole] || [];
  return permissions.includes(requiredPermission);
};

// Example: Check if user can delete products
if (
  hasPermission(user.role, UserManagementService.PERMISSIONS.DELETE_PRODUCTS)
) {
  // Allow deletion
}
```

### Frontend Route Protection

```javascript
// Admin-only routes
<ProtectedRoute requiredRole="admin">
  <UserManagementPage />
</ProtectedRoute>

// Multiple roles allowed
<ProtectedRoute requiredRole={["admin", "pharmacist"]}>
  <BatchManagementPage />
</ProtectedRoute>

// All authenticated users
<ProtectedRoute>
  <POSPage />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### 1. Permission Checking

Always check permissions on both frontend and backend:

```javascript
// Backend (server-side validation)
if (!UserManagementService.hasPermission(user.role, "delete_users")) {
  throw new Error("Insufficient permissions");
}

// Frontend (UI hiding)
{
  hasPermission(user.role, "delete_users") && (
    <button onClick={handleDelete}>Delete User</button>
  );
}
```

### 2. Role Changes

Only ADMIN can change user roles. Role changes require:

- Admin authentication
- Confirmation dialog
- Activity log entry

### 3. Sensitive Operations

Extra confirmation for:

- User deletion (double confirmation)
- Void transactions (requires reason)
- Role changes (confirmation dialog)

---

## 🚀 Implementation Status

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate:**

   - ✅ Run SQL migration for Testing User (`database/FIX_TESTING_USER_ROLE.sql`)
   - ✅ Refresh User Management page (F5)
   - ✅ Verify role badges show correct colors

2. **Testing Phase:**

   - Test as Admin: Verify all 19 permissions work
   - Test as Pharmacist: Verify 16 permissions, blocked from user management
   - Test as Employee: Verify 3 permissions only

3. **Production:**
   - Deploy updated RBAC system
   - Monitor for permission-related errors
   - Train staff on new permission structure
