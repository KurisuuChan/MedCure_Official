# Real Online Status Implementation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Situation

**What You're Seeing:**

- All users with `is_active = true` show as "ACTIVE"
- Last Login shows when they last logged in (9:30 AM today)
- But this doesn't mean they're **currently online**

**The Problem:**

- "ACTIVE" status means their account is enabled (not banned/disabled)
- It does NOT mean they're currently logged in and using the system
- Only Christian Santiago is actually online right now (you)

## âœ… Solution: Add Real Online Status Tracking

We need to track which users are **currently** using the application in real-time.

### Option 1: Simple Approach (5-minute implementation)

**Show online status based on recent activity (last 5 minutes)**

#### Changes Required:

1. Check if `last_login` is within the last 5 minutes
2. If yes â†’ Show "ONLINE" badge (green)
3. If no but within 24 hours â†’ Show "RECENTLY ACTIVE" badge (yellow)
4. Otherwise â†’ Show "OFFLINE" badge (gray)

#### Pros:

- Quick to implement
- No database changes needed
- Works with existing `last_login` field

#### Cons:

- Not 100% accurate (user might close browser without logout)
- Requires updating `last_login` on every page load/API call

---

### Option 2: Proper Session Tracking (2-hour implementation)

**Track actual browser sessions in database**

#### Changes Required:

1. Create `user_sessions` table
2. Create session on login â†’ Store session ID, login time, last activity
3. Update `last_activity` on every API call/page interaction
4. Delete session on logout
5. Auto-expire sessions after 15 minutes of inactivity
6. Real-time subscription to show live online/offline changes

#### Pros:

- 100% accurate real-time status
- Can force logout users remotely
- Can see multiple sessions per user (desktop + mobile)
- Professional standard approach

#### Cons:

- Requires database schema changes
- More code to maintain
- Needs proper session cleanup

## ðŸš€ Recommended: Option 1 First, Then Option 2

Let me implement Option 1 right now (5 minutes), which will give you:

- âœ… Accurate online status based on recent activity
- âœ… No database changes needed
- âœ… Works immediately

Then later (optional), you can upgrade to Option 2 for enterprise-grade session tracking.

## ðŸ“Š What You'll See After Fix

### User Table STATUS Column:

Instead of just "ACTIVE" / "INACTIVE", you'll see:

| Current            | After Fix                                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **ACTIVE** (green) | **ONLINE** (green) - Last activity < 5 min            |
| **ACTIVE** (green) | **RECENTLY ACTIVE** (yellow) - Last activity < 24 hrs |
| **ACTIVE** (green) | **OFFLINE** (gray) - Last activity > 24 hrs           |
| **INACTIVE** (red) | **INACTIVE** (red) - Account disabled                 |

### Example:

```
Testing User        CASHIER    INACTIVE          Never
Rhealiza Nabong    MANAGER    OFFLINE           10/6/2025, 9:30:54 AM
Charles Vincent    CASHIER    OFFLINE           10/6/2025, 9:31:14 AM
Christian Santiago ADMIN      ðŸŸ¢ ONLINE          10/6/2025, 9:31:21 AM
```

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### What I'll Change:

1. **Update `last_login` on every page load** (not just on login)
2. **Add online status badge** with accurate calculation
3. **Color coding:**
   - ðŸŸ¢ Green = Online (< 5 min)
   - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow = Recently Active (< 24 hrs)
   - âš« Gray = Offline (> 24 hrs)
   - ðŸ”´ Red = Inactive (account disabled)

---

Would you like me to implement Option 1 right now? This will make the status accurate and show who's **actually online** vs just having an active account.
