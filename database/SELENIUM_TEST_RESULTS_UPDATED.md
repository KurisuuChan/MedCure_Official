## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Root Cause

Buttons with text inside child `<span>` elements weren't being detected by simple XPath selectors.

### Solution Implemented

Created advanced button-finding utilities with multiple fallback strategies:

- Direct text matching
- Child element text matching
- Normalized space matching

### Tests Fixed

1. ✨ Dashboard: Refresh button
2. ✨ Dashboard: Time period filters
3. ✨ Dashboard: Alerts button
4. ✨ Inventory: Filters button
5. ✨ Inventory: Analytics & Reports tab
6. ✨ Dashboard: Dashboard loaded check
