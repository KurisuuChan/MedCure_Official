\*Needs SQL migration from CASHIER to EMPLOYEE

---

## 🛠️ Migration Needed

### Testing User Still Shows "CASHIER"

**Quick Fix:**

```sql
-- Update Testing User role
UPDATE users
SET role = 'employee', updated_at = NOW()
WHERE email = 'test@pharmacy.com' OR role = 'cashier';
```

**Verify:**

```sql
-- Check current roles
SELECT role, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY role;
```

**Expected Result:**

- admin: 1
- pharmacist: 1
- employee: 2
- Total: 4 users
