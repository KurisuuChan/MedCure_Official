# 🚀 User Management - Quick Fix Summary

## The Problem

❌ User management features not working (can't add, edit, or delete users)

## Root Cause

Database only allowed roles: `admin`, `manager`, `cashier`  
Application used roles: `admin`, `pharmacist`, `employee`  
**Result**: CHECK constraint violation on create/update

---

## ✅ The Fix (2 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Run Database Migration (REQUIRED!)

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. Open file: `database/FIX_USER_MANAGEMENT_ROLES.sql`
3. Copy all contents
4. Paste in SQL Editor
5. Click **Run**

**You should see**:

```
✅ User Management Roles Fixed!
Database now supports both new and legacy role systems
```

### Step 2: Reload Application

Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) to hard reload

---

## 🧪 Quick Test

1. Go to **User Management** page
2. Click **"Add User"** button
3. Fill form:
   - Email: test@medcure.com
   - Password: Test123!
   - First Name: Test
   - Last Name: User
   - Role: Employee
4. Click **"Create User"**

**Expected**: ✅ "User created successfully!"

## 🎯 New Role System

| Role              | Level       | Can Do                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin** 🔴      | Super Admin | Everything (manage users, settings, reports)   |
| **Pharmacist** 🟢 | Manager     | Inventory, Sales, Reports (no user management) |
| **Employee** 🔵   | Basic       | View inventory, Process sales only             |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Still getting errors?

1. **Did you run the SQL migration?** → Run `FIX_USER_MANAGEMENT_ROLES.sql`
2. **Hard reload the page** → Ctrl+Shift+R
3. **Check console** → Press F12, look for errors starting with `❌ [UserManagement]`

### Common Errors:

**"Invalid role selected. Please run the database migration script."**
→ You forgot Step 1! Run the SQL migration.

**"A user with this email already exists"**
→ Use a different email

**"Password too weak"**
→ Use 8+ characters with letters and numbers
