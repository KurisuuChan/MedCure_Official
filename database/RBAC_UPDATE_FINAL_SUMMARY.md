```javascript
// ADMIN: Gets ALL permissions automatically
[this.ROLES.ADMIN]: Object.values(this.PERMISSIONS), // All 19

// PHARMACIST: 16 specific permissions
[this.ROLES.PHARMACIST]: [
  // User Management (1)

## 🎯 Current Users Status

| Name               | Email                   | Role          | Permissions  | Status   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Christian Santiago | admin@pharmacy.com      | 🔴 ADMIN      | 19/19 (100%) | ONLINE   |
| Rhealiza Nabong    | pharmacist@pharmacy.com | 🟢 PHARMACIST | 16/19 (84%)  | OFFLINE  |
| Charles Vincent    | employee@pharmacy.com   | 🔵 EMPLOYEE   | 3/19 (16%)   | OFFLINE  |
| Testing User       | test@pharmacy.com       | 🔵 EMPLOYEE\* | 3/19 (16%)   | INACTIVE |

\*Testing User still shows "CASHIER" in database - needs SQL migration

---

## 🚀 Next Steps for User

### 1. Refresh User Management Page

```
Press F5 or Ctrl+R to reload the page
```

**You should see:**

- ✅ Christian Santiago shows 🔴 "ADMIN" (red badge)
- ✅ Rhealiza Nabong shows 🟢 "PHARMACIST" (green badge)
- ✅ Charles Vincent shows 🔵 "EMPLOYEE" (blue badge)
- ✅ Testing User shows 🔵 "EMPLOYEE" (currently shows CASHIER - needs migration)

---

### 2. (Optional) Run SQL Migration for Testing User

If Testing User still shows "CASHIER", run this SQL:

```sql
-- Quick fix for Testing User
UPDATE users
SET role = 'employee', updated_at = NOW()
WHERE email = 'test@pharmacy.com' OR role = 'cashier';

-- Verify all roles
SELECT role, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY role;
```

**Expected result:**

- admin: 1
- pharmacist: 1
- employee: 2
