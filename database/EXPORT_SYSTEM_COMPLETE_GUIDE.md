## 🔧 Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Responsive Table Layout

**Problem:** Tables were cramped when selecting all 14 columns
**Solution:** Intelligent weight-based column sizing that adapts to any number of columns

**Features:**

- **1-5 columns**: Spacious layout with large fonts (9pt/8pt)
- **6-7 columns**: Standard layout with medium fonts (8pt/7pt)
- **8-9 columns**: Balanced layout with smaller fonts (7pt/6.5pt)
- **10-12 columns**: Compressed layout with compact fonts (6.5pt/6pt)
- **13-14 columns**: Maximum compression with smallest fonts (6pt/5.5pt)

### 2. ✅ Accurate Stock Calculations

**Problem:** Low Stock and Out of Stock counts were inaccurate
**Solution:** Use each product's individual `reorder_level` instead of hardcoded threshold

**Logic:**

```javascript
Out of Stock:  stock === 0
Low Stock:     stock > 0 AND stock <= reorder_level
Normal Stock:  stock > reorder_level
```

### 3. ✅ Smart Column Management

**Problem:** Needed reorder level for calculations but shouldn't display it
**Solution:** Hidden field system using `_reorder_level` prefix

**Benefits:**

- Accurate calculations without cluttering the display
- User only sees columns they selected
- System maintains necessary metadata
