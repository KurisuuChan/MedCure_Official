# Vercel Deployment Fix - React createContext Error

## Problem
Your Vercel deployment was failing with the error:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'createContext')
```

This error occurs when React is `undefined` when trying to use `React.createContext` in the bundled production code.

## Root Cause
1. **Aggressive code splitting**: The Vite config was splitting React packages too broadly with the pattern `includes("react")`, which caught React-related packages but not the React core itself consistently.
2. **Module resolution**: React 19 with aggressive chunk splitting can cause React to become undefined in certain chunks due to circular dependencies or incorrect load order.
3. **Named imports vs default imports**: Using `React.createContext` requires the default React import, but with modern React 19, direct named imports are preferred.

## Changes Made

### 1. **vite.config.js** - Fixed React bundling
**Changes:**
- More specific React chunk matching: Changed from `includes("react")` to `includes("react/")` and `includes("react-dom/")` with trailing slashes for exact matching
- Added `scheduler/` to the React chunk (scheduler is part of React internals and must stay with React)
- Added `commonjsOptions` to properly handle mixed ES modules
- Added `transformMixedEsModules: true` for better compatibility

```javascript
// Before:
if (id.includes("react") || id.includes("react-dom")) {
  return "vendor-react";
}

// After:
if (id.includes("react/") || id.includes("react-dom/")) {
  return "vendor-react";
}
if (id.includes("scheduler/")) {
  return "vendor-react";
}
```

### 2. **Toast.jsx** - Modern React imports
**Changed from:**
```javascript
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, useCallback } from "react";
```

**Changed to:**
```javascript
import { createContext, useContext, useState, useCallback } from "react";
```

This uses direct named imports instead of the default React import, which is the modern React 19 pattern.

### 3. **EnhancedToast.jsx** - Same fix applied
Applied the same modern import pattern to avoid React being undefined.

### 4. **vercel.json** - Added Vercel configuration
Created proper Vercel configuration for:
- SPA routing (all routes redirect to index.html)
- Asset caching headers
- Explicit build commands

### 5. **.npmrc** - Added NPM configuration
Created proper NPM settings for:
- Consistent dependency resolution
- Proper module linking (hoisted)
- Exact version locking

## Next Steps

### 1. Clean and Rebuild Locally
```bash
# Remove old build artifacts
rmdir /s /q node_modules
rmdir /s /q dist
del package-lock.json

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Test local build
npm run build

# Test production build locally
npm run preview
```

### 2. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve React createContext error for Vercel deployment"
git push
```

### 3. Redeploy to Vercel
Vercel should automatically detect the push and redeploy. If not:
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Click "Redeploy" on your project
- Select "Use existing Build Cache" = **OFF** (important!)

### 4. If Issues Persist

If you still see errors, try these additional steps:

#### Option A: Clear Vercel Build Cache
In Vercel dashboard:
1. Settings → General → Build & Development Settings
2. Clear build cache
3. Redeploy

#### Option B: Add explicit externals to vite.config.js
Add this to the config:
```javascript
build: {
  rollupOptions: {
    external: ['react/jsx-runtime'],
  }
}
```

#### Option C: Update package.json with resolutions
Add this to package.json:
```json
"resolutions": {
  "react": "19.1.1",
  "react-dom": "19.1.1"
}
```

## Environment Variables
Make sure all required environment variables are set in Vercel:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Any other custom env vars your app uses

## Testing After Deployment
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Test all major routes
3. Verify component rendering
4. Check network tab for chunk loading order

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Exact matching prevents false positives**: Using `react/` instead of `react` prevents other React-related packages from being incorrectly bundled
2. **Scheduler inclusion**: React 19 uses the scheduler package internally, keeping it with React prevents runtime errors
3. **Named imports**: Direct named imports from 'react' are more reliable in ES modules and don't depend on React default export
4. **CommonJS transformation**: Ensures compatibility with any CommonJS modules in your dependency tree
5. **Vercel config**: Ensures proper SPA routing and build configuration

## Additional Notes

- The lint warnings about Fast Refresh are pre-existing and don't affect production builds
- React 19 prefers named imports over default imports
- The chunk splitting is optimized for performance while maintaining proper dependencies

## Support

If you continue to experience issues:
1. Check the Vercel build logs for specific errors
2. Test the production build locally first with `npm run preview`
3. Ensure all environment variables are properly set
4. Check that all dependencies are properly installed
