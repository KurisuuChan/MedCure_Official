# 📚 Demand Forecasting - Simple User Guide

## 🎯 What is Demand Forecasting?

**In Simple Terms:** It's like having a crystal ball that predicts which medicines will sell and when you need to order more!

### How It Works:
1. **AI Looks at Your Past Sales** - Analyzes the last 90 days
2. **Finds Patterns** - Sees what sells fast, what sells slow
3. **Predicts the Future** - Tells you what will happen next month
4. **Suggests Actions** - Tells you when and how much to order

## 🆘 Common Questions

### **Q: Why do some products show "Need More Data"?**
**A:** New products or slow sellers don't have enough sales history yet. The system needs 30+ sales to make good predictions.

### **Q: Can I see older forecasts?**

**A:** It updates with every sale! More recent data = more accurate prediction.

### **Q: What's the difference between "Expected" and "Best Case"?**
