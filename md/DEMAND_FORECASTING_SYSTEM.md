## üßÆ Algorithms Explained

### Moving Average
Calculates average sales over rolling time periods:
- **7-day average**: Short-term trends
- **30-day average**: Standard baseline
- **90-day average**: Long-term patterns

### Trend Detection
Compares recent performance (last 7 days) vs previous period (7-14 days ago):
```
Trend % = (Recent Sales - Previous Sales) / Previous Sales √ó 100
```

### Seasonal Adjustment
Applies multipliers during peak seasons:
- **Peak Season**: 1.3x multiplier (30% increase)
- **Off Season**: 0.9x multiplier (10% decrease)

### Confidence Score
Calculated based on:
- **Data Points** (40%): More history = higher confidence
- **Recency** (30%): Recent data = higher confidence
- **Consistency** (30%): Low variance = higher confidence

### Reorder Point Calculation
```
Reorder Point = (Daily Usage √ó Lead Time) + Safety Stock
Safety Stock = Z-Score √ó ‚àö(Demand Variability) √ó Daily Usage
```

## üìä Data Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- At least **7 days** of sales history for basic forecasts
- At least **30 days** of sales history for accurate trends
- At least **90 days** of sales history for seasonal detection

### Data Sources
The system automatically pulls from:
- `sale_items` table (quantity sold per transaction)
- `sales` table (transaction dates and status)
- `products` table (current stock, reorder levels)

### Database Query Example
```sql
SELECT 
  quantity,
  created_at
FROM sale_items
WHERE product_id = 'xxx'
  AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
ORDER BY created_at ASC;
```

## üîß Configuration

### Demand Level Thresholds
Adjust in `demandForecastingService.js`:
```javascript
static DEMAND_LEVELS = {
  HIGH: { min: 10, label: "High", color: "green", icon: "‚ÜóÔ∏è" },
  MEDIUM: { min: 3, label: "Medium", color: "yellow", icon: "‚Üí" },
  LOW: { min: 0, label: "Low", color: "orange", icon: "‚ÜòÔ∏è" },
};
```

### Trend Thresholds
```javascript
static TRENDS = {
  INCREASING: { threshold: 0.15 },  // 15% increase
  STABLE: { threshold: 0.15 },       // ¬±15%
  DECLINING: { threshold: -0.15 },   // 15% decrease
};
```

### Seasonal Categories
Add custom seasonality in `SEASONAL_CATEGORIES`:
```javascript
"Your Category": { 
  seasonal: true, 
  peakMonths: [1, 2, 12]  // Jan, Feb, Dec
}
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: No forecasts showing
**Solution**: Ensure products have sales history
```javascript
// Check if product has sales data
const salesHistory = await DemandForecastingService.getSalesHistory(productId, 30);
console.log("Sales records:", salesHistory.length);
```

### Issue: Low confidence scores
**Solution**: Products need more sales history (aim for 30+ days)

### Issue: Inaccurate forecasts
**Causes**:
- Irregular sales patterns
- New product (insufficient history)
- External factors (promotions, supply issues)

**Solutions**:
- Wait for more data accumulation
- Manually adjust reorder levels
- Consider external factors in planning

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Review forecasts weekly**: Adjust based on real-world factors
2. **Update reorder levels**: Keep thresholds aligned with forecasts
3. **Monitor confidence scores**: Low confidence = manual verification needed
4. **Use seasonality data**: Plan ahead for peak seasons
5. **Combine with experience**: AI assists, but human judgment is key
6. **Track accuracy**: Compare forecasts to actual sales
7. **Train staff**: Ensure team understands the metrics
