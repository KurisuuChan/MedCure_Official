# üö® FIXING THE PRICE UPDATE ISSUE

## ‚ùå The Problem

**You said:** "Price didn't change even after I ran out the earlier batch"

**Root Cause:** Your POS system uses `create_sale_with_items()` which was NOT updating batches properly, so the trigger never fired.

---

## ‚úÖ The Solution (3 SQL Files to Run in Order)

### Step 1: Run the Update Script
**File:** `20250101_fifo_batch_pricing_UPDATE.sql`

This creates:
- ‚úÖ `update_product_price_from_fifo()` function
- ‚úÖ `trg_update_price_on_batch_depletion` trigger
- ‚úÖ Enhanced batch number format (BT101325-001)

### Step 2: Run the Integration Script üî• **MOST IMPORTANT**
**File:** `20250101_fifo_batch_pricing_INTEGRATION.sql`

This **replaces** `create_sale_with_items()` to:
- ‚úÖ Deduct from oldest batches first (FIFO)
- ‚úÖ Update batch status to 'depleted' when empty
- ‚úÖ This triggers the price update automatically

**‚ö° This is the critical fix!**

### Step 3: Run the Debug Script (Optional)
**File:** `20250101_fifo_batch_pricing_DEBUG.sql`

This helps you:
- ‚úÖ Verify trigger exists
- ‚úÖ Check for price mismatches
- ‚úÖ See which batches are active
- ‚úÖ Get diagnostic info

## üéØ How It Works Now

### Before (Broken):
```
1. Customer buys product
2. create_sale_with_items() runs
3. Stock decreases BUT batch status doesn't update
4. Trigger never fires
5. ‚ùå Price stays the same
```

### After (Fixed):
```
1. Customer buys product
2. create_sale_with_items() runs
3. System deducts from oldest batch (FIFO)
4. Batch quantity becomes 0
5. Batch status ‚Üí 'depleted'
6. ‚ö° TRIGGER FIRES ‚ö°
7. update_product_price_from_fifo() runs
8. ‚úÖ Product price updates to next oldest batch!
```

## üìã Step-by-Step Testing

### 1. Set Up Test Data

**Add two batches with different prices:**

```javascript
// Batch 1 (Oldest - will sell first)
Product: Biogesic 500mg
Quantity: 5 pieces
Purchase: ‚Ç±40
Selling: ‚Ç±50
‚Üí Batch: BT110125-001

// Batch 2 (Newer - sells after Batch 1)
Product: Biogesic 500mg
Quantity: 10 pieces
Purchase: ‚Ç±45
Selling: ‚Ç±60
‚Üí Batch: BT110125-002
```

**Check product price:**
- Should show: ‚Ç±50 (oldest batch)

### 2. Make a Sale

**Sell 5 pieces (exactly depletes Batch 1):**

```
POS ‚Üí Add Biogesic ‚Üí Quantity: 5 ‚Üí Complete Sale
```

### 3. Verify Auto-Update

**Check product page:**
- ‚úÖ Price should NOW show: ‚Ç±60 (Batch 2)
- ‚úÖ Batch 1 status: 'depleted'
- ‚úÖ Batch 2 status: 'active'

**Check Supabase Logs:**
```
Sold 5 units from batch BT110125-001 (0 remaining)
Trigger fired: Batch BT110125-001 depleted, updating product price
Updated product price: ‚Ç±50 ‚Üí ‚Ç±60 (Batch: BT110125-002)
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "I ran the scripts but price still didn't update"

**Solution 1: Manual Refresh**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT refresh_all_product_prices();
```

**Solution 2: Check Trigger**
```sql
-- Verify trigger exists
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgname = 'trg_update_price_on_batch_depletion';
```

**Solution 3: Check Batch Status**
```sql
-- See all batches for a product
SELECT 
  batch_number,
  quantity,
  status,
  selling_price,
  created_at
FROM product_batches
WHERE product_id = '<your-product-id>'
ORDER BY created_at ASC;
```

### Issue: "Batch status is still 'active' after depletion"

**Cause:** Old version of `create_sale_with_items` still running

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you ran `20250101_fifo_batch_pricing_INTEGRATION.sql`
2. Check function version:
```sql
SELECT prosrc 
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname = 'create_sale_with_items';
-- Should contain "status = CASE WHEN quantity..."
```

### Issue: "Multiple batches with same product, all active"

**This is normal!** You can have multiple active batches. The system will:
1. Sell from oldest first
2. When oldest depletes ‚Üí price updates
3. Next oldest becomes current

---

## üß™ Advanced Testing Scenario

### Test: 3 Batches, Different Prices

```
Setup:
‚îú‚îÄ Batch A: 10 pcs @ ‚Ç±45 (oldest)
‚îú‚îÄ Batch B: 20 pcs @ ‚Ç±50
‚îî‚îÄ Batch C: 30 pcs @ ‚Ç±55 (newest)

Product shows: ‚Ç±45 ‚úÖ

Action 1: Sell 10 pieces
Result: Batch A depleted ‚Üí Price updates to ‚Ç±50 ‚úÖ

Action 2: Sell 20 pieces  
Result: Batch B depleted ‚Üí Price updates to ‚Ç±55 ‚úÖ

Action 3: Sell 15 pieces
Result: Batch C has 15 left ‚Üí Price still ‚Ç±55 ‚úÖ

Action 4: Sell 15 pieces
Result: Batch C depleted ‚Üí No more batches ‚Üí Price stays ‚Ç±55
        (Until you restock)
```

## üìä Monitoring & Verification

### Check Product vs Oldest Batch Price

```sql
SELECT 
  p.name,
  p.price_per_piece as "Current Price",
  (
    SELECT selling_price 
    FROM product_batches 
    WHERE product_id = p.id 
      AND quantity > 0 
      AND status = 'active'
    ORDER BY created_at ASC 
    LIMIT 1
  ) as "Oldest Batch Price",
  CASE
    WHEN p.price_per_piece = (
      SELECT selling_price 
      FROM product_batches 
      WHERE product_id = p.id 
        AND quantity > 0 
        AND status = 'active'
      ORDER BY created_at ASC 
      LIMIT 1
    ) THEN '‚úÖ Match'
    ELSE '‚ùå Mismatch'
  END as "Status"
FROM products p
WHERE p.stock_in_pieces > 0
LIMIT 20;
```

### Check Recent Sales with COGS

```sql
SELECT 
  s.id,
  s.created_at,
  s.total_amount as revenue,
  s.total_cogs,
  s.gross_profit,
  s.profit_margin_percentage
FROM sales s
WHERE s.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
ORDER BY s.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Batch Allocations for a Sale

```sql
SELECT 
  pb.batch_number,
  sba.quantity_sold,
  sba.batch_purchase_price,
  sba.batch_selling_price,
  sba.item_profit
FROM sale_batch_allocations sba
JOIN product_batches pb ON pb.id = sba.batch_id
WHERE sba.sale_id = '<sale-id>'
ORDER BY sba.created_at;
```

## üéØ Key Points to Remember

1. **Trigger ONLY fires when batch status changes**
   - From 'active' ‚Üí 'depleted'
   - When quantity reaches 0

2. **Integration script is ESSENTIAL**
   - Without it, batches don't update properly
   - Trigger has nothing to fire on

3. **Manual refresh is a backup**
   - Use if trigger doesn't fire
   - Safe to run anytime

4. **FIFO is automatic**
   - You don't control which batch sells
   - System always picks oldest

5. **Price updates are instant**
   - Happens in same transaction as sale
   - No delay

---

## üöÄ Next Steps After Fix

### 1. Test in Production

1. Run all 3 SQL files in order
2. Create test batches with different prices
3. Make test sales to deplete batches
4. Verify prices update automatically

### 2. Add Monitoring

```jsx
// In your admin dashboard
import BatchPriceRefreshButton from './components/admin/BatchPriceRefreshButton';

<div className="admin-tools">
  <BatchPriceRefreshButton />
</div>
```

### 3. Train Staff

- Prices update automatically
- No manual price changes needed
- Watch for "depleted" batch status
- Report any stuck prices immediately

---

## üìû Emergency Fixes

### Quick Fix: Manual Sync All Prices

```sql
SELECT refresh_all_product_prices();
```

### Force Update Single Product

```sql
SELECT update_product_price_from_fifo('<product-id>');
```

### Check Trigger Activity (Logs)

```sql
-- In Supabase Dashboard
-- Go to: Logs ‚Üí Postgres Logs
-- Search for: "Trigger fired"
```

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Your system is working correctly when:

- [x] New batch added ‚Üí Product shows oldest batch price
- [x] Sale depletes batch ‚Üí Price auto-updates to next batch
- [x] Batch status changes from 'active' to 'depleted'
- [x] No manual intervention needed
- [x] Supabase logs show "Trigger fired" messages
- [x] Product price always matches oldest active batch
