# 🌸 Dynamic Seasonality Detection - AI Learning from YOUR Data

## 🎉 What Changed?

The seasonality detection is now **DYNAMIC** - it learns from YOUR pharmacy's actual sales data instead of just using fixed category rules!

---

## 🧠 How It Works Now

### **Two-Tier System:**

#### **Tier 1: Dynamic AI Detection (Primary)** ✨
- Analyzes YOUR past sales month-by-month
- Finds patterns automatically
- Learns YOUR pharmacy's unique seasonality
- **Example:** If YOUR Biogesic sells 50% more in December, the AI detects it!

#### **Tier 2: Static Category Rules (Fallback)** 📋
- Used when not enough data for AI detection
- Based on general medical knowledge
- **Example:** Antibiotics typically peak during flu season

---

## 📊 How Dynamic Detection Works

### **Step 1: Collect 12 Months of Data**
```javascript
January:   Average 150 units sold
February:  Average 145 units sold
March:     Average 100 units sold
April:     Average 95 units sold
May:       Average 90 units sold
June:      Average 130 units sold
July:      Average 140 units sold
August:    Average 105 units sold
September: Average 95 units sold
October:   Average 100 units sold
November:  Average 135 units sold
December:  Average 155 units sold
```

### **Step 2: Calculate Overall Average**
```javascript
Total Average = (150+145+100+95+90+130+140+105+95+100+135+155) / 12
              = 120 units per month
```

### **Step 3: Find Peak Months (>30% Above Average)**
```javascript
January:   150 ÷ 120 = 1.25 (25% above) → Not a peak
February:  145 ÷ 120 = 1.21 (21% above) → Not a peak
December:  155 ÷ 120 = 1.29 (29% above) → Not a peak
June:      130 ÷ 120 = 1.08 (8% above)  → Not a peak
July:      140 ÷ 120 = 1.17 (17% above) → Not a peak

// Hmm, need to adjust threshold...
// Let's use >20% for this example:
January:   ✅ PEAK (25% above)
February:  ✅ PEAK (21% above)
December:  ✅ PEAK (29% above)
```

### **Step 4: Calculate Confidence Score**
```javascript
Data Quality = 12 months ÷ 12 = 100% ✅
Variance = High variation between months = 80% ✅
Peak Count = 3 peak months ÷ 4 = 75% ✅

Confidence = (100% × 0.4) + (80% × 0.3) + (75% × 0.3)
           = 40% + 24% + 22.5%
           = 86.5% confidence! 🎯
```

### **Step 5: Calculate Seasonal Factor**
```javascript
Current Month = December
December Average = 155 units
Overall Average = 120 units

Seasonal Factor = 155 ÷ 120 = 1.29x

// This means: Expect 29% more sales in December!
```

---

## 🎯 Requirements for Dynamic Detection

### **Minimum Data Needed:**
- ✅ At least **100 sales transactions** in history
- ✅ Sales data from at least **6 different months**
- ✅ At least **2 peak months** detected (>30% above average)
- ✅ **Coefficient of variation > 0.25** (significant ups and downs)

### **If NOT Enough Data:**
- ⚠️ Falls back to static category-based detection
- 📋 Uses general medical knowledge (e.g., antibiotics = flu season)
- 📊 Shows "Category Based" badge instead of "AI Detected"

## 📱 What You'll See in the UI

### **When AI Detects Seasonality:**
```
🌸 Seasonal Medicine [AI Detected]

Peak sales during: Jan, Feb, Dec

💡 During peak months, expect 29% more sales than normal

Pattern Confidence: 87%
[████████████████████░░] 87%
```

**Tooltip:** "Our AI analyzed YOUR sales data and detected this product sells more during certain months. This is based on your actual pharmacy's sales patterns!"

### **When Using Static Rules:**
```
🌸 Seasonal Medicine [Category Based]

Peak sales during: Dec, Jan, Feb, Jun, Jul

💡 During peak months, expect 30% more sales than normal

Pattern Confidence: 70%
[██████████████░░░░░░] 70%
```

**Tooltip:** "Based on typical seasonal patterns for this medicine category (antibiotics = flu season, allergy meds = spring, etc.)"

### **When Not Seasonal:**
```
No seasonal badge shown
```

---

## 🔢 The Math Behind It

### **Coefficient of Variation Formula:**
```javascript
// Measure how much sales vary month-to-month
Standard Deviation = √(variance)
Coefficient of Variation = Standard Deviation ÷ Average

// Example:
Average = 120 units
Standard Deviation = 35 units
CoV = 35 ÷ 120 = 0.29 (29% variation)

// If CoV > 0.25 → Significant seasonal pattern!
```

### **Seasonal Factor Calculation:**
```javascript
// How much to adjust forecast for current month
Current Month Average = 155 units
Overall Average = 120 units

Factor = Current Month ÷ Overall Average
       = 155 ÷ 120 = 1.29

// Cap between 0.6x and 1.8x to avoid extreme values
Final Factor = Math.min(Math.max(1.29, 0.6), 1.8) = 1.29x
```

### **Peak Month Detection:**
```javascript
// Month is considered "peak" if significantly above average
Deviation = (Month Average - Overall Average) / Overall Average

If Deviation > 0.30 (30%):
  ✅ This is a PEAK month
Else if Deviation < -0.30 (-30%):
  ⚠️ This is a LOW month
Else:
  ➡️ This is a NORMAL month
```

### **AI Analysis:**
```javascript
✅ Peak Months Detected: Jan, Jun, Sep, Dec
✅ Pattern: 4 distinct peaks throughout year
✅ Confidence: 92% (high data quality + clear pattern)
✅ Method: Dynamic AI Detection

💡 Insight: This pharmacy sees vitamin spikes during:
- January: New Year health resolutions
- June: Mid-year health push
- September: Back to school season
- December: Holiday preparation
```

### **Forecast Adjustment:**
```javascript
// If today is December:
Base Forecast = 120 units
Seasonal Factor = 1.58x (58% above average)
Adjusted Forecast = 120 × 1.58 = 190 units

// System tells you: "Order 190 units, not just 120!"
```
