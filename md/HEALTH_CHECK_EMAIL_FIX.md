# Health Check Email & Critical Stock Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Medication Details in Health Check Emails**

Previously, comprehensive health check emails only showed basic product names and stock levels, without critical medication details like:

- Manufacturer
- Dosage (strength + form)
- Supplier
- Batch Number

### 2. **Duplicate Product Entries**

Out of stock items were being added to the email once per user, causing duplicate entries in the comprehensive health summary.

## Changes Made

### NotificationService.js

#### 1. **Enhanced Database Queries**

All three health check functions now fetch additional fields:

```javascript
// checkLowStockDetailed()
.select("id, brand_name, generic_name, stock_in_pieces, reorder_level, category_id,
         manufacturer, dosage_strength, dosage_form, supplier, batch_number")

// checkExpiringProductsDetailed()
.select("id, brand_name, generic_name, expiry_date,
         manufacturer, dosage_strength, dosage_form, supplier, batch_number")

// checkOutOfStockDetailed()
.select("id, brand_name, generic_name, stock_in_pieces,
         manufacturer, dosage_strength, dosage_form, supplier, batch_number")
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Product Details Objects**

Each function now builds complete product detail objects:

```javascript
productDetails.push({
  name: productName,
  stock: stock, // or expiryDate, daysRemaining for expiring items
  reorderLevel: reorderLevel,
  isCritical: isCritical,
  severity: isCritical ? "CRITICAL" : "WARNING",
  manufacturer: product.manufacturer || "Not Specified",
  dosage:
    `${product.dosage_strength || "N/A"} ${product.dosage_form || ""}`.trim() ||
    "Not Specified",
  supplier: product.supplier || "Not Specified",
  batchNumber: product.batch_number || "Not Specified",
});
```

#### 3. **Fixed Duplicate Out of Stock Entries**

Moved product detail collection OUTSIDE the user loop:

```javascript
// BEFORE (INCORRECT - inside user loop)
for (const user of users) {
  for (const product of products) {
    productDetails.push({...}); // Added once per user!
  }
}

// AFTER (CORRECT - before user loop)
for (const product of products) {
  productDetails.push({...}); // Added only once
}

for (const user of users) {
  for (const product of products) {
    // Create notifications only
  }
}
```

#### 4. **Enhanced Email Template**

Updated `generateComprehensiveHealthEmailTemplate()` to display all fields:

**Out of Stock Section:**

```
❌ [Product Name]
   • Status: COMPLETELY OUT OF STOCK
   • Manufacturer: [Manufacturer]
   • Dosage: [Strength] [Form]
   • Supplier: [Supplier]
   • Batch: [Batch Number]
```

**Low Stock Section (Critical & Warning):**

```
🚨 [Product Name]
   • Stock: [X] pieces (Reorder Level: [Y])
   • Manufacturer: [Manufacturer]
   • Dosage: [Strength] [Form]
   • Supplier: [Supplier]
   • Batch: [Batch Number]
```

**Expiring Soon Section (Critical & Warning):**

```
⏰ [Product Name]
   • Days Remaining: [X] days (Expires: [Date])
   • Manufacturer: [Manufacturer]
   • Dosage: [Strength] [Form]
   • Supplier: [Supplier]
   • Batch: [Batch Number]
```

## Critical vs Warning Categorization

### Low Stock Items

- **CRITICAL**: Stock ≤ 50% of reorder level OR ≤ 5 pieces (whichever is smaller)
- **WARNING**: Stock > 50% of reorder level but ≤ reorder level

### Expiring Items

- **CRITICAL**: Expires within 7 days
- **WARNING**: Expires within 8-30 days

### Out of Stock Items

- **All items are CRITICAL** (stock = 0)

## Notes

- **PDF reports** in AnalyticsReportsPage.jsx already had comprehensive medication details
- **Email templates** now match the PDF report detail level
- All fields use **"Not Specified"** instead of "Update Required" for missing data
- Critical categorization is consistent across emails and PDFs
- Stock alerts properly differentiate between low stock (>0) and out of stock (=0)

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add category breakdowns in email summary
2. Include financial impact calculations (stock value at risk)
3. Add supplier contact information in urgent alerts
4. Include historical trend data (e.g., "Stock decreasing 20% weekly")
5. Prioritized action plan suggestions based on urgency and stock value
