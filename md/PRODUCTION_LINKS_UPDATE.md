3. **Professional** - No localhost URLs in production emails
4. **Consistent** - All email types use the same production domain
5. **Secure** - HTTPS protocol for all links

---

## 🧪 Testing

When testing emails, verify that:

- ✅ All Quick Action buttons link to production domain
- ✅ Dashboard link: `https://www.medcure-official.me/dashboard`
- ✅ Inventory link: `https://www.medcure-official.me/inventory`
- ✅ Settings link: `https://www.medcure-official.me/system-settings`
- ✅ Links open in production environment

## 📝 Notes

### Route Consistency

Note that the settings route was updated to match the production route structure:

- Development: `/settings`
- Production: `/system-settings`

This ensures email links work correctly in production environment.

### Dynamic Links

Product detail links and other dynamic URLs use the base domain:

```javascript
productInfo.actionUrl
  ? `• Product Details: https://www.medcure-official.me${productInfo.actionUrl}`
  : "";
```

This allows any internal route to work with the production domain.

No additional deployment steps needed. The changes are in the email template generation code and will automatically apply to:

- New emails sent after deployment
- Manual health checks
- Scheduled daily summaries
- All notification types
