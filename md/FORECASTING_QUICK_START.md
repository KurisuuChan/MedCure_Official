## 🎯 How to Use It

### Step 1: View the Dashboard
```
http://localhost:5173/forecasting
```

You'll see:
- Summary cards (High Demand, Trending, Need Reorder, Critical Stock)
- Filter/search tools
- All products with forecast cards
- Click any product for detailed analysis

### Step 2: Add to Existing Pages
Add demand indicators to inventory or product pages:

```jsx
import DemandIndicator from '../components/analytics/DemandIndicator';

// In your product card/row:
<DemandIndicator 
  productId={product.id} 
  size="sm" 
  showDetails={true}
/>
```

### Step 3: Test It
```bash
node test-forecasting.js
```

This will:
- Load your actual sales data
- Generate forecasts for top products
- Show trend analysis
- Display reorder suggestions

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Demand Thresholds
Edit `src/services/domains/analytics/demandForecastingService.js`:

```javascript
static DEMAND_LEVELS = {
  HIGH: { min: 10, ... },     // Change to 15 for stricter
  MEDIUM: { min: 3, ... },    // Adjust as needed
  LOW: { min: 0, ... },
};
```

### Add Custom Seasonality
```javascript
static SEASONAL_CATEGORIES = {
  "Your Category": { 
    seasonal: true, 
    peakMonths: [6, 7, 8]  // Jun, Jul, Aug
  },
};
```

### Adjust Forecast Period
```javascript
// Get 60-day forecast instead of 30
const forecast = await DemandForecastingService.getForecast(productId, 60);
```

## 🔍 Key Metrics Explained

### Demand Level
- **High**: Sells 10+ per day (stock these heavily)
- **Medium**: Sells 3-10 per day (maintain good stock)
- **Low**: Sells <3 per day (order conservatively)

### Trend
- **Increasing**: Sales up 15%+ (order more!)
- **Stable**: Sales steady ±15% (maintain)
- **Declining**: Sales down 15%+ (reduce orders)

### Days of Stock
```
Days = Current Stock ÷ Daily Average
```
- **0-3 days**: 🔴 Critical - Order immediately
- **4-7 days**: 🟠 Low - Order soon
- **8-14 days**: 🟡 Moderate - Plan to order
- **15+ days**: 🟢 Good - No rush

### Confidence Score
- **70-100%**: Trust the forecast
- **50-69%**: Use as guidance
- **<50%**: Needs more data

## 🚨 Common Issues

### "No forecasts showing"
- **Cause**: No sales history in database
- **Fix**: Ensure `sale_items` table has data

### "All forecasts show 0"
- **Cause**: Products haven't been sold
- **Fix**: Wait for sales or use mock data for testing

### "Low confidence scores"
- **Cause**: Insufficient sales history (<30 days)
- **Fix**: Normal for new products, confidence improves over time

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Test with real data** - Run `node test-forecasting.js`
2. **Add to inventory page** - Embed `<DemandIndicator>`
3. **Train your team** - Show them `/forecasting` dashboard
4. **Monitor accuracy** - Compare forecasts to actual sales
5. **Adjust thresholds** - Fine-tune based on your pharmacy's patterns
