# System Settings Service Integration Fix ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. NotificationManagement - Service Method Errors

**Problem:**

```javascript
TypeError: (intermediate value).listNotifications is not a function
```

**Root Cause:**

- Component was calling `notificationService.listNotifications()`
- Actual method name is `getUserNotifications()`

**Solution:**

```javascript
// ❌ Before
const data = await notificationService.listNotifications(20);

// ✅ After
const result = await notificationService.getUserNotifications(user.id, {
  limit: 20,
  offset: 0,
});
setNotifications(result?.notifications || []);
```

**Additional Improvements:**

- Added user ID check before loading notifications
- Proper handling of notification result structure
- Added user dependency to useEffect

### 2. SecurityBackup - Service Method Errors

**Problem:**

```javascript
Uncaught TypeError: (intermediate value).getSecuritySettings is not a function
```

**Root Cause:**

- Multiple service method names were incorrect
- Component called non-existent methods

**Available Methods in SecurityBackupService:**

- ✅ `loadSecuritySettings()` - Get security settings
- ✅ `saveSecuritySettings(settings)` - Save security settings
- ✅ `createManualBackup()` - Create manual backup
- ✅ `getLastBackupInfo()` - Get last backup information
- ✅ `cleanupOldBackups()` - Cleanup old backups

**Solutions Applied:**

```javascript
// ❌ Before
await SecurityBackupService.getSecuritySettings();
await SecurityBackupService.updateSecuritySettings(settings);
await SecurityBackupService.createBackup();
await SecurityBackupService.downloadBackup();
await SecurityBackupService.restoreBackup();
await SecurityBackupService.importBackup(file);

// ✅ After
await SecurityBackupService.loadSecuritySettings();
await SecurityBackupService.saveSecuritySettings(settings);
await SecurityBackupService.createManualBackup();
// Removed unimplemented features (download, restore, import)
```

**Simplified Component:**

- Removed Download, Restore, and Import backup features (not implemented in service yet)
- Simplified to only 2 working features:
  1. **Create Manual Backup** - ✅ Fully functional
  2. **View Last Backup Info** - ✅ Fully functional
- Added error handling for loadSecuritySettings with fallback defaults

## Testing Results

```

### After Fix

```
✅ NotificationManagement loads successfully
✅ SecurityBackup loads successfully
✅ Notifications fetched from database
✅ Manual backup creation works
✅ Security settings save properly
✅ No critical errors
```

## Remaining Warnings

All remaining issues are **non-critical linting warnings**:

- Prop validation suggestions (cosmetic)
- Form label accessibility (cosmetic)

The System Settings page now:

- ✅ Loads without errors
